To make it easier to install coccinelle, to not have to bother about
where some of menhir object files are, we simply have copied some
files from the menhir distribution. Those files are needed for the
parsers generated with the --table menhir option. The files in this
directory are thus copyrighted by the menhir authors, François Pottier
and Yann Régis-Gianas, and covered by the GNU Library General Public
License version 2.
